# Integration process

![diagram](../img/firmware-update-integration-process.png)

As you can see in the diagram, the entire firmware upgrade integration process
starts with completing a customer survey. The customer survey will help 3mdeb
engineers understand your needs. You will need to provide details about your
device. Also, you will need to describe your current firmware upgrade process.
Also we will ask you if you have any experience with Linux Vendor Firmware
Service (LVFS).

The second part of the Basic integration is the LVFS support service. 3mdeb
engineers will help you set up an LVFS account. You will also receive
documentation on how to upload new firmware updates to the LVFS.
<!-- In the future here should be mentioned LVFS firmware upload service -->
